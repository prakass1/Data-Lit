This analysis is done to understand based on what parameters does a loan status depend upon.

For the analysis below are libraries used:
Language: Python 3.X
Data Processing and Engineering: pandas, scipy
Visualizations: seaborn
Machine Learning: sklearn

Statistics utilized:
1. Using pandas perform data cleaning to remove large number of columns, filtering values and engineering new values
2. Used seaborn to help in visualizing some of the key aspects of data analysis such as correlation analyis, bar graph, distribution plots, count plots, box plots.
3. Used scipy to perform statistical analysis to check if annual income is normally distributed.

Using these principles, read the notebook one will have understanding of the entire data present. Pending parts remaining is to utilize machine learning to automatically predict the loan status based of the features.

PCA - Principle component analysis and other analysis are not done to the dataset because there are certain features which are quite essential for the classification.
