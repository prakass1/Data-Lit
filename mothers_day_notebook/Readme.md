It was amazing to create this project.

The project pretty much does work as below:
1. Extracts and searches for tweets based on the keywords (I have used for mothers day. One can always change to something else for interesting results)
2. Used those tweets and created some interesting insights
3. Used those insights to create a mothers day word cloud using only tweet texts around the world and India
